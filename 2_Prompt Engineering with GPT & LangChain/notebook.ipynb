Large language models output only text. In order to call a function (to access a tool) based on the text output of a large language model, we can use agents. They can parse the text output, pick the correct tool and define its input.\n\nThe langchain framework has a wide variety of built-in tools, along with the ability to define additional custom tools. A very common use case for tools is accessing document stores or vector databases to ingest information from our own documents. This will be explored more in-depth in future modules.\n\nFor now, to have a gentle introduction to tools, we have decided on one that does not require external set up (no API token that needs to be created or external database that needs to be set up). \n\nIn this example, we will make use of the `PythonREPLTool`. This allows the GPT-model to run the Python code that it generates, and can be useful for carrying out an abundance of tasks.\n\nNote: as we introduce recursive prompts using agents, it is best practice to always define a maximum number of output tokens. This ensures our costs will not skyrocket if a prompt loop takes too long.","metadata":{},"id":"709a8d80-fb26-4f83-9cf2-19e6cbb00557","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### Instructions\n\nBefore we continue with our financial analysis, let's create a quick example of how code can be ran using a Python agent.

Looking back at the output from our last call to the Python agent, we may find that it created rule sets on how to extract the company name or determine the sentiment. These hard-coded rules negate the power of large language models! We will improve on this in Task 7.\n\nAnother problem that might arise is that the *sentiment* of a sentence can differ from *financial sentiment*. For example, an aggressive headline complaining about a large corporation making too much profit might result in negative sentiment, while from a financial analysis point of view the sentiment is positive. To steer the GPT-model to our desired outcome, we will now introduce few shot learning.\n\nFor example, *Company X was awarded a new contract* might be categorized as a neutral sentence.
